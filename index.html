                As you can see in the photo, I worked as a barista in Brooklyn for ages. At the start of the year, in the Before Time, I moved from New York to the Hague with my partner, Sharon, and our cat-son, Tilden. Now I split my time between learning to code, reading anti-Racist works, exploring the Dutch countryside on my bike, and playing video games. And cooking, I also enjoy cooking.
